      <description>I recently migrated my WordPress blogging platform to generating static content with Hugo. I no longer pay for hosting. I exclusively use GitHub pages. I am now blogging at no extra cost other than domain renewal!
In the process not only did I learn about Hugo, but I also looked at three ways to deploy / host my Hugo-made website.
In this post I want to share with you what Hugo is, why I like it and those three ways that I learned on how to deploy a Hugo website - with Azure Static Web Apps (preview), Azure Blob storage and GitHub pages.</description>
