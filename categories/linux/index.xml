      <description>I run LibreNMS in my homelab on a Ubuntu Server VM and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome.
  
For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting notifications for needing to bump from PHP 7.0 to 7.2 minimum.
I mostly followed this post but I&amp;rsquo;ll detail a step that helped me automate installing and uninstalling all the extra modules which the last two steps seem to miss. I&amp;rsquo;ll also detail a snag I hit with nginx slapping me with 500 after updating to PHP 7.</description>

      <description>For my home lab on a particular VM that runs Ubuntu Server, I&amp;rsquo;m interested to know the public IP of my LAN&amp;rsquo;s gateway and the VM&amp;rsquo;s gateway (as it&amp;rsquo;s always connected to VPN). Below is a script I wrote to pull the WAN IP from my DD-WRT router and compare that to VM&amp;rsquo;s gateway public IP.
My copy does other things like start/stop services, configure local applications in my home lab as well as use Pushbullet to notify me if certain conditions are met.</description>
