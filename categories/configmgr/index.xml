      <description>I recently wrote a PowerShell script that reports on what folders are used or unused by System Center Configuration Manager.
You can find it here on GitHub.
I demoed the script at the London Windows Manager User Group, you can watch the recording below on YouTube.
  Among a bunch of technical topics, I also learned a huge amount of valuable soft/personal things too.
Enough is enough I started writing in February and since then I have refactored the script and the idea itself many times.</description>

      <description>Currently my lab&amp;rsquo;s primary site is running on 2012 R2. I recently wanted to try LEDBAT so I could sell it to a customer but it needed to be on 2016 or newer. I could have configured a 2016 &amp;ldquo;source DP&amp;rdquo; using pull distribution points and still get the experience, but then I was curious if IPU while ConfigMgr is installed was possible, turns out it is. Then I discovered I had SQL 2012 SP2 installed!</description>

      <description>ℹ️ It looks like as I was writing this Microsoft have just publicly released a former internal document detailing some things that I had claimed to be undocumented (click here): Deep, deep, DEEP dive into content distribution in #SCCM by the great @vinay_pamnani Internal-only content originally, now free for public use! https://t.co/oUPTSzrTmt
&amp;mdash; Matt Toto (@_contoto) February 4, 2019   In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover ways you can control bandwidth for Configuration Manager using the rate limit config available for each distribution point.</description>

      <title>ConfigMgr Hardware Inventory Troubleshooting</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently updated a site to 1806 and was keen to get all clients up to date too. Some machines targeted for the pre-production client were not upgrading. When I looked closer at one client I suspected client health because a hardware inventory had not been submitted in months.
Little did I know until recently, a lack of recent hardware inventory data could be a result of other things and client health is least likely to be the root cause.</description>
